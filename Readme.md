This is a Readme for git branch tutorial.
Adding one more line to practice git pull. As suppose this edit is done by different devloper and he has pushed the new changes. Now I need to pull it to my local repository.
Review the Readme by pull, now I am pushing themy local changes to remote repo.

Now I am adding the text in Readme in testing branch. This will diff the master with testing branch. Then I will change other files in master branch to do ort merge.

Adding this text from master branch in Readme to create merge conflict. Same changes I will do on testing branch.
